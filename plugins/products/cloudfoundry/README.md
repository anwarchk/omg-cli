# CF Shortcut Product Plugin 
```
this product is a shortcut to a cf product plugin. Its intent is to demonstrate
a organic migration approach from existing yaml based implementations. 
This is to be used as an example of how to enamlize an existing deployment 
without a wholesale re-write.

We use an existing deployment manifest to initialize an
enaml.DeploymentManifest. From there we can leverage all of the power of enaml,
without coding up the boilerplate stuff upfront. Hence shortcut :)
